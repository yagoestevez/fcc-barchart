---

This project was made for the 4th module in freeCodeCamp which requires the camper to code a D3 Bar Chart representing the data taken from [this JSON document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/GDP-data.json).

#### User Stories

The project required the following user stories to be fulfilled:

1. My chart should have a title with a corresponding id="title".
2. My chart should have a g element x-axis with a corresponding id="x-axis".
3. My chart should have a g element y-axis with a corresponding id="y-axis".
4. Both axes should contain multiple tick labels, each with the corresponding class="tick".
5. My chart should have a rect element for each data point with a corresponding class="bar" data.
6. Each bar should have the properties data-date and data-gdp containing date and GDP values.
7. The bar elements' data-date properties should match the order of the provided data.
8. The bar elements' data-gdp properties should match the order of the provided data.
9. Each bar element's height should accurately represent the data's corresponding GDP.
10. The data-date attribute and its corresponding bar element should align with the corresponding value on the x-axis.
11. The data-gdp attribute and its corresponding bar element should align with the corresponding value on the y-axis.
12. I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding id="tooltip" which displays more information about the area.
13. My tooltip should have a data-date property that corresponds to the data-date of the active area.
